# SEIRS malware model with time-dependent rates

The repository has all the matlab files relevant to the simulations carried out in the development of the project. The prefix PAPER refers to experiments carried out with the model proposed in "Dynamical analysis and control strategies on malware propagation model" by Feng et al in 2013, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2013.03.051.

They are organized as follows:

- SEIR, SIR, Proposal, and Paper refer to functions that solve differential equations numerically.
- Tests is the main file in which the parameter variation was carried out.
- SEIR_FIG, SIR_FIG, PROPOSAL_FIG, and PAPER_FIG are the executables which generates the GUIs that allow a more pleasant visualization of the corresponding models, and allow to enter the desired parameters.
